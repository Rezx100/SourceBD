# SourceBD - Current State

Last compacted for agent-token efficiency: 25 Jun 2026.

## Phase
Phase 7 - Public Beta launch prep.

## Shipped Baseline
- Phase 0 data moat and Phases 1-5 are shipped in the codebase.
- Phase 6 hardening H1-H8 is shipped in codebase.
- FE-SITEWIDE design conformance pass is complete enough to be the current visual baseline.
- P1 deploy artefacts and Phase 7 P2-P4 beta surfaces are reported as landed.

## Current Goal
Launch-readiness closeout:
- Deploy to VPS `109.104.153.228`.
- Apply migrations 0048-0049 and 0060 to production Supabase.
- Run the 30-day zero P1/P2 Sentry incident window before calling beta fully live.

## Recent Frontend Polish
25 Jun 2026 - Frontend design stabilization pass complete in working tree.
Presentation-only changes: solid nav chrome, iPhone-safe bottom navigation,
full-width hairline Discover cards, and cleanup of touched prototype
card/typography drift across marketing and app surfaces. `pnpm typecheck`
and `pnpm lint` pass; `pnpm build` compiled successfully but failed during
Windows standalone symlink copy with `EPERM`.

## Recent Maintenance
25 Jun 2026 - Context-token optimization complete. Daily agent boot now uses
`AGENTS.md`, `context/agent-brief.md`, `context/current-state.md`, and
`context/feature-specs/active.md`; the old append-only tracker is archived.

## Current Working Tree Warning
At the start of the token-optimization task, the repo already had a large uncommitted frontend/design diff plus deleted old Magic UI component files. Treat those as pre-existing user/session work unless explicitly told otherwise. Do not revert them while doing context cleanup.

## Daily Development Rules
- For micro edits, do not read the full historical tracker or all feature specs.
- Load only the core boot files plus the active spec and task-relevant source documents.
- Before asserting whether a file is modified, check `git status` or `git diff` against HEAD.
- For debugging, state the hypothesis and minimal change before editing when `context/current-issues.md` is involved.

## Historical Record
The old full tracker was archived at `context/archive/progress-tracker-archive-2026-06-25.md`. Use that archive for old shipped-spec details, architectural decisions, and production smoke history.
